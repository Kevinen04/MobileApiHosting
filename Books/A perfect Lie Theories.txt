For instance, the sudden shift in Brielle's character from a contented spouse to a murderer can be jarring for readers. 
You might consider adding more depth and complexity to her character, as well as to the other characters in the story. 
Additionally, the resolution of the story may benefit from a more nuanced approach, rather than relying on a simple act of revenge.

Overall, I suggest revisiting your story and fleshing out the characters, their motivations, and the themes of the story. 
Doing so can make for a more engaging and thought-provoking read.

Sure, here are some potential plot twists that could happen based on the current story:

1. Brielle is actually the one who killed Sarah, but she has repressed the memory and is now experiencing a breakdown.

2. Taylen is not actually Brielle's husband, but is an imposter who has been living with her and her daughter for years.

3. Onna, Brielle's daughter, knows more about Sarah's death than she's letting on and has been hiding a secret from her mother and stepfather.

4. Rose, Brielle's friend, is actually working with the police and is investigating Brielle as a suspect in Sarah's murder.

5. Joey, Taylen's friend, is actually Sarah's brother and has been trying to uncover the truth about her death, but has been keeping it a secret from Taylen.

-How to get rid of Taylen`s body, is too cut him into small pieces and left it in the zoo to feed to the lions.
