She uses her shape-shifting abilities to blend in and gather information, and her lightning powers to strike down those who had committed heinous crimes.
However, as she delves deeper into the underworld of crime and corruption, she realizes that there are bigger forces at play, and that her own family may be in danger.

The story could explore themes of identity, justice, power, and the consequences of taking matters into one's own hands. 
It could also delve into the supernatural and mystical elements of the protagonist's abilities, and the history and mythology behind the magical stone and
the serpent shape-shifting powers.

The protagonist's father may have been keeping her true identity a secret from her for a reason. Perhaps there is some danger associated with being a shape-shifting
serpent, and he wanted to protect her from harm by keeping her in the dark.

The protagonist's journey to embrace her true identity as a shape-shifting serpent could be fraught with challenges and conflicts. She may struggle to come to terms
with her powers and what they mean for her relationships with other humans. She may also face discrimination and persecution from others who fear or misunderstand her 
species.
